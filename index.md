# Data Science For Business

Welcome to my Data Science for Business (DSB) web site.

On my overview page, I ma providing an introduction to this topic and motivate my passion on using [Data Science for Business]()

I also make the point that at eventually a skill set must be mastered to actually **do** data science.

## Pandas

The central object of data science are tables. These tables can be created and operated on using the library Pandas which can be installed to Python.
Using Pandas, you can create and maninpulated tables, you can work on its columns and rows, you save and retrieve these tables, merge and split them, and you make aggregations on their values.
Get here to the detals of [Pandas](pandas).
