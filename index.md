# Data Science For Business

Welcome to my Data Science for Business (DSB) web site. You might have come here from the main website [drmaseway](https://www.drmaseway.com) which covers broadly Data Science or because you are searching for specific details on Data Science in Python. 

Here we walk through many examples and give many - hopefully helpful - details on how to create tables Python for Data Science, i.e. Pandas Dataframes, how to visualize data and how to model typical business scenarios.


## Pandas

The central object of data science are tables. These tables can be created and operated on using the library Pandas which can be installed to Python.
Using Pandas, you can create and maninpulated tables, you can work on its columns and rows, you save and retrieve these tables, merge and split them, and you make aggregations on their values.
Get here to the detals of [Pandas](pandas).

## Models

We should understand which are common and helpful [models](models).

## Example

Let me show an intermediate result on the journey to business modelling:

On this web site, we go through the details on how to create such models and graphs.
