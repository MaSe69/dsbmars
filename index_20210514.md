# Beautiful dataframes

Python and Julia offer all functionality described above. R presumably does so as well and probably many other languages, too. 

Julia's dataframe seems to have copied quite a bit of Python Pandas. The underlying philosophy of Julia seems to be, however, quite different from Python.

Python rather goes at length to make your program run through. Julia in contrast requires you to specify precisely what you want. In consequence, Julia's dataframes have diverted from Python's dataframes and this gap probably will continue to widen. With the high adoption of Python Pandas, it might be difficult for substantial changes. The Julia community might wish for more adoption but this felt moderate adoption also enable deprecations.

In any case, considerable detailed knowledge needs to be built up to become fluent in either Python or Julia dataframes. This can lead to a language lock-in.

A dictionary for dataframes in Julia and Python can be an essential bridge to cross from the one language to the other, when the context demands for other one.

First, you need to be assured that the requested functionality is there in the other language.
Then, you need to find the respective syntax.
Finally, some coding snippets and best practices can be helpful.

### Comparison of Dataframes in Python and Julia

Programming simultaneously in both langauge can be sometimes confusing. A cheat sheet to compare dataframes in Python and Julia might help:
